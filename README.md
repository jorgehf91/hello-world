# hello-world
My first repository.
This is my first time using git, or any control version software whatsoever.
I'm a 25 year old venezuelan trying to make my way through the world, specially in the special circumstances of my country. I'm mostly self-taught. I love to learn and discover by myself. 

My aspirations and interests are wide, but to name a few pertaining to this computing world: software dev (game dev, web dev and phone app dev), unix, programming, computing sciences,hacking, hardware, networks/telecomm, machine learning, and everything computer related.

Currently my time is consumed learning in FCC, smashing my head with linux, the terminal, the unix architecture in general; learning C, python, JS and web dev languages
and frameworks. Also, a little of computer and phone maintenance. But my short-medium term goal is to become a full stack web freelancer. And in the future a machine learning or data scientist! (With fiction writing, painting, comic illustration and filmmaking as satellites hobbies).

#I hope I can leave my country before the cunning and evil government cuts the Internet from the people, as right now basic necessities are scarce and works more like a lottery#

Wish me luck, stranger. And dance!
